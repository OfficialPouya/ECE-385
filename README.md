# ECE-385
This is my personal repo for ECE385 If you are a student currently enrolled in ECE385, for the love of GOD don't cheat. I will try to only update assignments on here AFTER due dates. You are more than welcome to see my approach.

For Recruiters, All assignments on here are assigned by the ECe385 course staff. https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE385

If you are intrested in my personal projects, check out that repo! You are more than welcome to replicate those projects!
